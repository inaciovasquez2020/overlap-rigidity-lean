Overlap Rigidity (Lean Formalization)

This repository contains the canonical Lean formalization of the Overlap Rigidity assumptions used in the Final Wall program. It is a frozen dependency and serves as a formal backbone for the mathematical structures and predicates that underpin the conditional overlap rigidity axiom.

Repository Purpose

The goal of this project is to formalize, in the Lean theorem prover, the essential definitions and properties required for the Overlap Rigidity axiom used in the conditional Final Wall research program. As a frozen artifact, it is not under active development but is maintained for reproducibility and dependency tracking.

Formalization Goals

This repository provides:

Canonical definitions of core graph and local structure constructs

Formal predicates capturing local cycle overlap properties

Encoded assumptions reflecting the Overlap Rigidity axiom

Verified properties such as monotonicity, locality invariance, and absence of rigidity amplification

These formalizations support the mechanical verification of key theoretical claims in the broader Final Wall program.

Status

STATUS: Frozen
ROLE: Canonical Lean dependency for Final Wall
ASSUMPTION: Overlap Rigidity axiom (isolated)
GUARANTEES: Monotonicity, FO-local invariance, no rigidity amplification

How to Use

Clone the repository.

Inspect the formal Lean files to understand the definitions and assumptions.

Use this formalization as a dependency when building or verifying other artifacts in the Final Wall program, especially those requiring overlap rigidity predicates.

Contribution

This repository is frozen by design. Major contributions, changes, or fixes should be discussed with the Final Wall program maintainers.

If you believe there is an issue or improvement that would benefit the overall research program, please open an issue referencing how it interacts with the conditional dependencies indexed elsewhere.
